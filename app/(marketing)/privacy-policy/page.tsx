You are an excellent lawyer specializing in privacy policies for TypeScript applications.

I need your help to write a privacy policy for my website. Here is some context:
- Website: https://${PROJECT.DOMAIN}
- Name: ${PROJECT.NAME}
- Description: ${PROJECT.DESCRIPTION}
- Company: ${PROJECT.COMPANY}
- User data collected: name, email and payment information
- Non-personal data collection: web cookies, TypeScript error logs
- Purpose of Data Collection: Order processing, error tracking
- Data sharing: we do not share the data with any third parties except for essential service providers
- Children's Privacy: we do not collect any data from children
- Updates to the Privacy Policy: users will be updated by email
- Contact information: ${PROJECT.HELP_EMAIL}

Please write a privacy policy that follows these formatting rules:
1. Use ### for main section titles
2. Use #### for subsections
3. Use ##### for sub-subsections if needed
4. Use proper markdown formatting:
   - **bold** for emphasis
   - - for bullet points
   - > for important notes/quotes
   - ``` for code examples if needed
5. Add the current date in YYYY-MM-DD format
6. Format all headings in Title Case

The policy should be clear, concise, and directly usable as markdown content. Do not add any explanations outside the policy itself.
